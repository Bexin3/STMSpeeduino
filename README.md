Compatible with Giga R1 wifi, portenta h7 and possibly other stm32h747 boards.

As of now this library is still in development, as well as its doccumentation, I plan to add ADC 3 usage possability, and direct memory access, as well as other than analog features.

Highest possible clock speed without compromising range is abiut 40mhz.
For now with unfinished documentations, look into examples to see how to use functions, and I also will be releasing an osciloscope library based on this soon.

Ammount of clock cycles different resolutions take up:
16bits - 10
14bits - 9
12bits - 8
10bits - 7
8bits  - 6
